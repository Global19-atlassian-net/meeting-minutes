* Bridge foundry: recommended that we follow the tutorials on their website
* Goal for RustBridge team is to operate independently of the other teams
* Find a regular meeting time- hannelita started work on this here: https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge/issues/7#issuecomment-227253901
* decide on what workshops we should create
* would anyone like to take the lead on organizing
* H: in the past, community teams self select
* Fine to join the #rust-community channel for communicating between meetings
* aepsil0n volunteered to organize the next meeting
* should be treated as an independent organization, so we don't have too many loops in communication decision making
* how to get ahold of us
* community-team@rust-lang.org

# Start the bridge tutorial

* Carefully checked to make sure that the tutorial of yesterday compiles today. compiler is stable, but not all the libraries. Finding a topic that's immune to that would be helpful.
* people come in from very different backgrounds, having multiple tutorials
* RailsGirls is mainly about building a website (but RailsBridge does have multiple tutorials for different levels, on different subjects, frontend vs backend, etc http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/)
* How a computer works may be easier on the Rust side
* Maybe implementing a tutorial or two
* for railsbridge, tutorials are about 4-5 hours
* Training for RustConf http://rustconf.com/training.html
* Text adventure game: https://github.com/tildeio/learning-rust
* Make tutorials executable, and wire into travis to give us notification if things break
* game ecosystem is pretty unstable, which might not be great foundation for a tutorial at the moment
* could start with with csv or basic calculation
* could implement a very little window api that based on something simple. implement 3 to 4 things
* move rectangle from A to B
* another option would be to use ARM arduino if you want to
* piston has a tendency to break backwards compatibility
* implement a simple networking api
* what are our personas?
* everyone has accessed one website, that's a safe intro
* scape content of a website
 * everyone creates a wishlist in amazon
 * sorted list of items. send data to friends
 * match books that we both want
* https://diversitytickets.org/
 * verbally agreed to donate some amount of money from mozilla
* http://opensourcebridge.org/
* Denote when is a good meeting time in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJbkASQS4JxP5WDHLbnun4odlDpLA-a_z6F_s5Jpup8/edit?usp=sharing
