# Agenda

- (none)

# Updates

- Things with Rust book sorted out with Moz legal

# RFCs for 1.x guarantees

- Discussed backwards compatbility and how best to clarify the situation.
- Existing RFCs mostly cover the necessary details:
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md
- However, a single, more concise document might be helpful.

# Prod user priorities

We should keep in mind priorities that have been raised by potential
production users.

In particular:

- Dropbox -- abort on panic to avoid need to write exception safety code
  (they are already resilient against crashes)
- Mozilla -- allocator RFC https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1183
- Tilde -- catch_panic https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1236
