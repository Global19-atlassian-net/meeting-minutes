# Agenda 2016-01-27

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/issues/289
- specialization extravaganza (aturon)
- copyright dates (brson)
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31007
- rename UFCS? (steve)
    UFCS = "fully qualified path"
    (and RAII?)

# Web site translations

- Increasing community interest in offering translations of e.g. the web site
- Want to have a clear, proactive, offiicial process here
- Outcome of discussion: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/translations-for-rust/3126?u=aturon

# Copyright dates

- See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31007

# Naming UFCS

Best candidate so far: "qualified path"

- `<T as Trait>::method` - fully qualified
- `T::method(val, ..)` - type qualified
- `Trait::method(val, ..)` - trait qualified

Also applies to projections:

- `<T as Trait>::Type`
- `T::Type`
- `Trait::Type` <-- this doesn't make any sense :)

# Specialization: dealing with lifetimes

Specialization cannot rely on lifetime information (due to trans limitations, undesirability of tying dispatch to region inference):

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self);
}

impl<T> Foo for T {
    default fn foo(&self) { println!("hi"); }
}

impl<T: 'static> Foo for T {
    fn foo(&self) { println!("static"); }
}

fn bar<T>(bar: &T) {
    Foo::foo(bar) // you might expect this to print "hi" or "static" depending on whether T: 'static
}
```

Options:

- "Principled approach": somehow make this situation an error outright

```rust
#[lifetime_dependent]
trait Foo { .. }

// this is ok because of the attribute
impl Foo for &'static str { ... }

trait Bar { .. }

impl<'a> Bar for (&'a u8, &'a u8) { ... }

impl<T> Bar for T {}
impl<T: Foo> Bar for T {} // you can't do this
impl<T: 'static> Bar for T {} // you can't do this

#[lifetime_dependent]
trait From<T>

impl<'a, E: Error + 'a> From<E> for Box<Error + 'a>
```

Problems:
    - complicated, no easy mental model; another knob in the trait system
    - sort of hard to predict which you will want
    - breaking change to add or remove the attribute
    - would rule out using `From` in specializaton, likely many others
    - Conclusion: this is basically a non-starter

- "Worse is better approach": allow these impls, but do something sensible if you ever exercise them

- We can potentially "ignore" impls that require knowledge of lifetimes for the purposes of specialization
- We could probably issue warnings when this happens
- Why warn and not error?
    - this can arise when combining two traits that you have no control over
    - if we make this a hard error, then you are just stuck and cannot combine those crates
    - if the spec is for purposes of performance, prob fine to fallback to slower path
- By warning of course we mean lint, maybe default to error
- In simple cases (intracrate) we can see the problem at declaration site
- But in extreme cases it would be when combining two crates
- To have a problem, would have to take types from one crate and feed them to another

- pushed thoughts on stack (nmatsakis)
    - if we expect people to use conversion traits in spec, they wouldn't necessarily be able to take advantage of `Box<Error>`?
