# RFC 1214

- brson: Seem to be a lot of regressions around RFC 1214
- brson: Looks like the biggest breakage we've seen, by far
- aturon: But we've had warning cycles, right?
- nmatsakis: multiple
- aturon: Surprising that people haven't updated?
- nmatsakis: Not really. But not clear how many of these crates are active.
- aturon: It's going to an error only on current nightly?
- nmatsakis: Yes
- aturon: Maybe we should revert until we understand better the situation.
- nmatsakis: Maybe, but I'd like to have a clear plan about when it's OK to roll out.
- aturon: How much outreach did we do for this?
- nmatsakis: Not a lot.
- nmstaskis: Reluctant to roll back because there's a lot of complexity in the compiler with the warnings -- it's actually hard to roll back.
- nmatsakis: Alternatively, can introduce a lint with default to error rather than warn -- that addresses issues with upstream crates, due to the lint cap.
- aturon: I like that a lot. Separates breakage into purely local pain, rather than amplifying it through dependencies (and resulting in dependency hell)
- nmatsakis: It doesn't look like most of these regressions are tied to RFC 1218

General plan: in the future, warnings -> errrors by default (but overridable) -> hard errors

Action items:
- assess how many regressions are tied to RFC 1218 (nmatsakis, ASAP)
- get the message out about the upcoming breakage (beyond RFC 1218) -- brson to cross-post, after regressions are triaged

# FAQ

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/pull/202

- brson: A bunch of web page work is about to land. The FAQ is one of the most important. Need to get a lot of eyes on this.

# Backcompat issues

https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3ylgvf/why_are_projects_from_just_a_few_months_ago/

- pcwalton: There was a reddit thread discussing backcompat issues (many people chiming in). Three main categories:
- #1: libc was reexporting a lot of winapi; it was fixed in some release
- #2: std::os::errno became non-public

    (but this was never stable?) http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0-alpha/std/os/fn.errno.html removed in 1.0.0-beta

- #3: intrinsics became private

    (but they were never stable...)

- #4: std::libc was public but went private

    (?? was removed in Feb 2014)

- #5: some crates where having multiple versions is deeply problematic, e.g. log

http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.4.0/std/os/index.html
http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.5.0/std/os/index.html

Conclusion: perhaps we need to hide pre-1.0 crates by default
