# Agenda

- Plans for the book
- https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/223#issuecomment-158498090 again
- docs and external crates?

# Reorganizing The Rust Book

- https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/trpltoc

- Longstanding policy that we don't include external crates in the docs/book.
- A couple reasons to do this. Want to avoid playing favorites/being heavy-handed.
- Also, the code isn't under control of the Rust community, maintainer could disappear, etc.

- Possible tweak: require crate to be 1.0+ version

- acrichto: I'm still hesitant re: stability and maintenance. I feel fine with rust-lang.
- aturon: May want to do it case by case. The benefit here is being able to present a "batteries included" flavor to the book.
- brson: OTOH, TRPL doesn't have to be the book to do this.
- acrichto: regex is a good example of a vetted crate.

# crates.io design

- Going to try to assemble some sort of "task force" to figure out web design strategy

# Regression worries

- A regression slipped through into stable. Want to make the process more robust.
- Proposal: devote time in specific core team meetings throughout cycle to various triage items, e.g. FCP, ungating, regressions
