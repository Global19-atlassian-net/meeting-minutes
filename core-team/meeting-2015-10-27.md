# Agenda

- PERMANENT ITEMS:
    - review subteam FCPs https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Afinal-comment-period

## Preparation for release

- regressions
- release notes
- blog post
- need to advertise msvc builds for windows
- prob still want to recommend mingw

## libcore / libstd

- there was some controversy about the facade design, particularly w/r/t to documentation
- unfortunate that rustdoc comments for items in core refrence libstd, but currently unavoidable
    - possible to improve in the future
- if we stabilize libcore, we enable stable rlibs
  - but not stable "core-only" executables/static libraries, because
    those rely on lang items provided in libstd, and the process for
    providing those is still unstable
- important to have some form of introductory documentation explaining:
    - core ideas of the facade (no pun intended)
    - common usage patterns, like unit tests that rely on std
- alternate subset design has promise but also some complications, and would represent a fairly large change for minimal benefit
- conclusion: existing design has worked well for quite some time, plan to stick with it

## FCP review

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1268
    - some downsides -- 
        - backwards incompatibility to add items, might be a bit surprising
        - complicates the impl of trait matching though, not clear that this has been fully thought out
        - summarized in: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1268#issuecomment-153071673

## Patterns

- semantics of pattern matching on constants is surprising to some
- How much to weight backwards compatibility here?
- Hard to judge.
- start a thread to discuss

### Stabilization priorities

- Benchmark tests.
- (incomplete notes here)
