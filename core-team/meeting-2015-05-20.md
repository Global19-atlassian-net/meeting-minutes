# TRPL translations

- Need a plan for translations of the book into other languages. With
  the release, there's a sense that the book is in its "final" form,
  and people have done initial Russian and Korean translations.
- Risk that translations don't keep up with changes. Is it OK to link
  to them even if they're not the same as the main "official" docs?
- Should look into tools that can help with this kind of translation.

Action items:

- brson will talk to Emily about setting up infrastructure
- steve will get some initial links on the page ("Community
  Translations") and work with these efforts

# Production user coordination

- Want to support production users; we should know who they are, find
  out their needs, etc.
- Maybe set up an NDA test suite where we can do regression testing
  against their source code.
- Set up a projects using Rust page.
- Also possibly a regular meeting with production users to hear needs,
  share challenges and solutions, etc.
- What exactly counts as "production" use of Rust? Can't just be "Rust
  code on github"

# Community subteam

We walked through the various ideas laid out here:
