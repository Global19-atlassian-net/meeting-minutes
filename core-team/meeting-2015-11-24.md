# Agenda

- community team rust logo
- web design -- (crates.io https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/223 )
- job board http://rust.jobboard.io/, jobs.rust-lang.org
- libs.rs

# Pending FCP RFCs

## 1196

- basic thrust foo::<T, _> == foo::<T>
- some unresolved issues around inference and fallback

## 1129

- `a[b] = c` this syntactic pattern prefers a new trait `IndexAssign`
  if implemented over `IndexMut`, to permit `map[key] = value`.
- Lots of ways to do insert, somewhat worrisome, particularly as `map[key] = value`
  is probably the most ergonomic but may not be the most common:

    * `map.insert(k, v)`
    * `map[k] = v`
    * ~~`map.place(k) <- v`~~
    * `map.entry(k) <- v`
    * `map[k] = v`
    * maybe eventually add `map[k] <- v`? (but see notes below) 

- On the other hand, it is potentially quite surprising for `map[k] =
  v` not to work.
- With vectors:

    * vec.push(v)
    * vec <- v
    * vec.front() <- v
        - makes sense on a deque, less on a vec
    * vec.back() <- v

- Note that `map[k] <- v` could be ambiguous if it's a map of placers
  (e.g., vectors!).

# Community team rust logo

- some requests to give blanket permission rather than reviewing
  requests
- giving blanket permission to use Rust logo feels premature
- particularly since (a) uses of trademark often seem harmless at
  first, but only after discussion are the opportunities for confusion
  made fully clear and (b) uses that come approved by a community team
  member would (rightly so) seem very official
- many uses, including meetups, are currently permitted by default anyway
- let's see how it goes with explicit requests
- we can expand sets of "automatic permission" if we find common things coming up again and again

# Web design

- https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/223
- the Python design looks reasonably nice, seems like a good starting point

# Job board

- erickt would like to make a job board, seems like a good idea
- one concern: is money changing hands? if people pay to post a listing, where does that money go?
- we can probably arrange to have mozilla earmark this money for Rust use

# libs.rs

- exciting developments as a useful means of categorizing ecosystem
