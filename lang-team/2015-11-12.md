# RFCs

RFC 1300 -- accept.

RFC 1268 -- We could accept it, but definitely some worries. No way to
know until we devote energy to experimenting. Biggest problem is weak
motivation, but the ExnSafe is perhaps the strongest
motivation. Accept but edit to include ExnSafe in motivation.

# Unassigned RFCs

https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1354

Consensus:
    - difficult for enums
    - not a lot of motivation, doesn't seem like a lot of people feel this would address problems that they are having
    - would be nice to make cfg-language richer in general though

# Name resolution

nmatsakis has been hacking on this. Rough idea of algorithm thus far:

```
loop {
    fixed point propagation of names into modules;
    expand macros that you can resolve;
} until no more macros could be expanded;
```

verify step:
      - check that no module has two bindings with same name
      - check that all paths user wrote can be resolved

```
use foo::bar::zed::*;
foo::bar! { }
```

http://is.gd/nsCmHb <-- error showing that `*` and public names conflict

```
// no error
mod foo {
    fn bar() {}
    
    mod baz {
        use super::*;
        use super::bar;
    }
}
```

https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-name-resolution-algorithm <-- prototype impl

```
mod foo {
    use std::i32;
    
    mod bar {
        use super::i32; // works in the prototype
    }
}
```

Thoughts were:
    - try to preserve some level of glob-vs-explicit preference
    - even if macro-generated names are highlander names
