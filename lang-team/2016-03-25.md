Disallow methods from traits that are not in scope      #31908    
      
    
```
fn foo<Default>(...) -> Default {
    ...
    let x = SomeType::default();
    ...
}
```

example breakage:
    
    ```
    struct Iterator { ... }
    ...
    foo.fold()
    ```
    
fixed by having prelude be a scope above

# no implicit prelude

Decision:
    - keep no-implicit-prelude semantics
    - when #[no_prelude] is stabilized, we deprecate (but do not remove) #[no_implicit_prelude]
    - reason: no need to break stable code since we can accommodate current semantics
