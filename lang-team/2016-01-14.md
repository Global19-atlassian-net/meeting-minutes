# Overlapping inherent impls

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22889#issuecomment-171782451

- conclusion:
    - try the stricter rules, see what crater impact is
    - kind of fine either way

# Precedence of comparison vs range

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22877
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28785
- seems like this is a subtle question that would require someone to prepare with all the relevant examples and tradeoffs
- can probably wait to make firm decision, perhaps see how official grammar starts to shake out

# RangeInclusive

https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1320

# Follow set for `ty`

He wants a macro that can parse:

```
i32 [ 22 ]
```

- Conclusion:
    - seems like a reasonable enough change, good to avoid breakage
    - make an issue and FCP it

# Try / `?` RFC

- Had planned to FCP but Gabhor asked not to
- But we've been getting tons of comments (150) perhaps due to nrc's link
- Debate has been circling around:
    - should we do `do` notation instead? (no pun intended)
    - is this an improvement on readability over `try!`
- No new points or themes raised, but some refinements on existing arguments:
    - `?` itself is fairly orthogonal from `do` notation
    - advantages to `?` over both `try!` and `do`:
        - method chaining
        - executing operation as a subexpression without lifting combinators
    - `?` could be integrated into some future `do` notation
- The `try` part of this RFC sort of conflicts with `do` because it introduces the delimited scope
- Conclusion:
    - move to FCP
    - emphasize that even if RFC is accepted, there is still a stabilization period where we can experiment with impl and "see how it feels" on nightly

# Pointer aliasing rules

- nmatsakis is thinking of gathering the various examples snippets posted into a central repo, along with explanations of *why* the example is of interest.

# Specialization update

- Lifetime dispatch is a complex problem
- Specialization requires you can "test" whether a trait is implemented, has problems when lifetimes are not known.
- How to resolve? Two basic strategies:
    - Come up with *some* consistent semantics such that trans/typeck comes up with the same specialization results
    - Basically any specialization that depended on the lifetime would take the more generic version
    - Would silently give you the more surprising semantics (or maybe warn)
    - We expect (read: hope --ed.) that this would be rare
- Alternative:
    - Try to prevent this from happening in the first place
    - Most promising way is to divide bounds into "bounds that may need precise lifetime info" and "bounds that don't"
    - Effectively have to categorize traits as "lifetime-dependent" or not
    - Each trait thus has a choice as to whether it will be lifetime-dependent -- and hence permit more impls -- or permit specialization
    - Ideally, default would be that it allows specialization
- Question from nmatsakis:
    - In the first strategy, we've been assuming the "less specialized" variant is "safer" to pick
    - This is not *entirely* clear, maybe someone is required to pick the specialized one for safety
	    - e.g., it's safe to run this code for any type T that is NOT Send??
    - When using negative bounds seems even less clear
    - But because of intuitionistic limitations that kind of code still seems pretty bogus

- Some examples that have come up thus far where traits are lifetime dependent:

```
#[lifetime_dependent]
trait Any: 'static 
impl<T: 'static> Any for T

trait Foo {}
impl<T> Foo for T {}
impl<T: Any> Foo for T {}
```

```
impl<'a, E: Error + 'a> From<E> for Box<Error + 'a>

impl<'a, E: Error> From<E> for Box<Error + 'a> // <- i could write this and just `panic` in the body...
```

- But we could rule this out by considering those two impls "unordered"
- Can we create this conflict some other way that we can't readily rule out? (e.g., by introducing indirection)

- Relevant: 
    - lifetime parameter crops up elsewhere
    - maybe can be generalized to recover parametricity for dropck?

# OIBIT vs structural

```
structural trait Foo
```

instead of

```
trait Foo {}
impl Foo for ..
```

- Existing syntax is bad:
    - non-obvious
    - suggests one can do "conditional" structuralness 

- Conclusion: thread on discuss
