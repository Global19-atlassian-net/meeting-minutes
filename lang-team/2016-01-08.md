# Where clauses without type parameters

PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27972

What to do about:

```
#[no_mangle]
pub fn bogus<'a>(x: &'a mut ()) where &'a mut (): Clone {
    <&'a mut ()>::clone(&x);
}
```

Alternatives:
    - report an error eagerly at typeck time
    - report an error only if you make use of the where clause (current behavior)
    - generate undefined behavior in trans (lacks a compelling use case, raises the question of precisely how to do that)
      - closest thing to a use case is some kind of naive code
        generator that may generate code for impossible cases, but not
        know when a case is impossible

No clear consensus yet, but also not a lot of strong
opinions. Reporting an error (or at least a lint) seems better.

# unused_variables and default methods

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26487

```
trait Trait {
    fn default(&self, name: String) { // warn?
    }
}
```

- quite a subtle, special-case rule
- probably surprising
- not the only case
- better to be consistent

# Future proofing macros

```
macro_rules foo {
    $x:expr => ...,
    $i:ident : $t:ty => ...,
}

foo!(x: i32) 
```

Conclusion:
    - this is a "soundness bug" in the macro future-proofing RFC
    - we will adjust our expression grammar (subject to the follow set rules we established)
    - eventually we hope to close the bug in the macro future-proofing RFC, but for the time being the rules only offers partial protection

# Naked fns

- Plan: first land RFC with some unresolved questions,
  then land PR then and try to bring it in sync with RFC.
