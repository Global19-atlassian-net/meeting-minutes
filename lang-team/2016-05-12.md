nrc commented
- impl for bool is sketchy:
    - do you want `?` to apply to false or true? often true?
    - also, just very low information
- aturon:
    - trait name can be improved but
- process-wise:
    - do we want to reach wider consensus?
    - yes:
        - thread on discuss to talk about it
        - link to thread from tracking issue, include crater result
        - even if we merge, we will have a FCP before reaching final decision
        - edit tracking issue to highlight current status
- lesson for next time:
    - clarify in RFC how we plan to *do* experimentation
