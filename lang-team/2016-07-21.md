# `?` operator

- aturon: people are asking about stabilization
- aturon: core version of the feature has landed, people are happy with it, but:
	- no catch
	- no carrier (only works with result)
- aturon: my sense is that we are in a good position to stabilize the base feature; 
- aturon: it was intentionally separated from `catch` anyhow
- aturon: (I do frequently find I want `catch` though)
- aturon: so assuming we want to do that push main sticking point is what to do about type conversions
- aturon: what we said when accepting RFC was that before we stabilize we need to at least know backwards compat constraints
- aturon: if we feel ok, we could land a result version and maybe generalize later
- aturon: obviously *fastest* thing to do might be to convince ourselves we can plausibly add conversions
- aturon: but then we'd have to do an rfc
- aturon: in any case we're supposed to do a cycle long tracking period anyhow
- nrc: for conversion; I did a PR that we decided not to land, but at least allows us to evaluate forward compat (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33389)
- nmatsakis: I feel like I know that we will have some problems, since I regularly do things like

```
    try!(foo.iter().collect())
```

- nmatsakis: but we did a crater run
- pnkfelix: but `?` isn't used that widely, right? box had similar problems
- nmatsakis: can we have `try!` desugar to `?` and do a crater run?
- aturon: regardless a bit risky since we are saying "we know it's not backwards compat but experimental evidence today suggests it will have minimal impact in future"
- nmatsakis: I imagine we might get things a bit faster if we had a trait ...
- aturon: we could have a trait with one impl for result but then impl type inference...?
- nmatsakis: ...and one dummy impl ought to work, I think, it'd be worth experimenting.
- seems like:
    - we should try to make a future-proofing thing
    - FCP the tracking issue
    - write and open an RFC to support `Option`
