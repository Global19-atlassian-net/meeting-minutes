Do we want to commit to the word lifetime?

Can we use identifier instead?

Enabling serde is is certainly interesting.

Why just parse this specific bit of grammar but not the rest?

Do we really expect people to write this sort of code in macro-rules... wouldn't you be better off writing a procedural macro long term? Feels like higher-order-macros are a rather complex model.

Test that builds a vec of ZST. Values implement destructor but have unsafe-no-drop-flag. Test is observing the number of drops that occur. 

eddyb claims that ZST w/ unsafe-no-drop-flag can't make sense (except though for idempotent dtor).

Options:
    - say it is undefined how many times drop runs
    - otherwise make it illegal
