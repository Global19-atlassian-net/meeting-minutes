### #1358

No right answer. Options we can enumerate:

- [ ] Error if an aligned struct is inside a packed struct
	- defer until we can have a focused discussion
	
- Just pick one: breaks ABIs
- Pick target: maybe confusing
- Pick target if C: maybe more confusing

- tricky because hygiene and doing resolution

### https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33380

- `x.foo():u8.bar()`
- `(x.foo():u8).bar()`
- `vec.iter().map().collect():Vec<_>.last()`

- `x.foo(): u8.bar()`
	
	vec.iter()
	   .map()
	   .collect(): Vec<_>
	   .something()

	(vec.iter()
	   .map()
	   .collect(): Vec<_>)
	   .something()

- hard to parse, though ok on a newline
- rules out `.` from type grammar
- options: yes/no/rfc?
  - nrc: no, having parens for type ascription makes it clearer what's going on

```
(self.as_ref():&[u8]).to_rmo_with(pool)
(self.as_ref(): &[u8]).to_rmo_with(pool) // current rustfmt output
self.as_ref():&[u8].to_rmo_with(pool)
self.as_ref::<[u8]>().to_rmo_with(pool)
self.as_ref<[u8]>().to_rmo_with(pool) // what we wanted, but can't get yet
self.as_bytes().to_rmo_with(pool)

(self.into():PathBuf).do_something()
self.into():PathBuf.do_something()
self.into::<PathBuf>().do_something()
self.into<PathBuf>().do_something() // what we wanted, but can't get yet
self.into_path_buf().do_something()
self.into(PathBuf).do_something() // magical
```

Fundamental problem:
    - `self.into():PathBuf.do_something()` is really hard to parse (visually, by human reader)
    - but using `: Vec<_>` in the middle of a chain is really nice, and parens are bad

Does ascription carry its weight if we DON'T accept this?
	  - nrc: I use it primarily for "type debugging", but I think it'd be nice if it had coercions

What is the weight:
    - interaction between `:` and `as` is subtle, maybe better handled via lint

Nominate type ascription (for removal)?
	  - nrc: I'd prefer to wait until we support coercion before we render a final judgement

### https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1593

- Coercion is usually transitive
- But deref coercions don't enjoy this property
- &Vec<T> coerced to 

Note that coercion is not transitive:

```
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    // &Vec<i32> -> &[i32] is a coercion,
    let s: &[i32] = &v;
    // and &[i32] -> *const [i32] is a coercion
    let t: *const [i32] = s;
    // but &Vec<i32> -> *const [i32] is not
    let u: *const [i32] = &v; // type mismatch error
    println!("{:?}", v);
}
```

```
fn take_str(_: &str) {}

fn main() {
    take_str(&&&"hello")
}
```

Today:
    &T -> &U is allowed if T: Deref<Target=U> (transitively)
    &T -> *const U is NOT (presently) allowed even if T: Deref<Target=U> (transitively)
    &T -> *mut U is NOT (presently) allowed even if T: DerefMut<Target=U> (transitively)

```
&v as *const _ // == as *const Vec<i32>
// should be ok since we'll be able to unify
```

&Box<T> -> &SomeTrait
where T: SomeTrait

- this would in principle require first checking whether `Box<T>: SomeTrait` (slash the unsizing rules etc)
- then deref to &T
- then check again for `T: SomeTrait`
- maybe not a problem, but certainly not cheap

- for now: leave as is, maybe come back later, should be backwards compat

### https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1477

- libs team rejected `Atomic<T>` but accepted more concrete types
- at the very least we ought to FCP #1477, maybe just close outright
