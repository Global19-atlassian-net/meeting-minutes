# Issue 35096

```
trait Foo<T> { }
Foo::method // in case we will replace T with a `_`
<_ as Foo>::method // must T be provided explicitly here?
```

answer today: yes, unless T has a default

```
trait Foo<T=u8> { }
Foo::method // in case we will replace T with a `_` (default ignored)
<_ as Foo<_>>::method // T is a fresh variable (default ignored)
<_ as Foo>::method // T is u8 (default applies)
```

```
struct Foo<T=u8> { t: T }
let foo = Foo { t: 'a' } // infer T to char
let foo = Foo::<char> { t: 'a' } // wacky but true
let bar: Foo = Foo { t: 'a' }; // ERROR
//       --- equivalent to `Foo<u8>`
// implies that `Foo` will be instantiated as `Foo<_>` (default ignored)
```

```
struct Foo<T>(T);
impl<T> Foo<T> {
    fn bar() {}
}
fn main() {
    Foo::bar();
    // Equivalent to:
    <Foo<_>>::bar();
    // Error:
    <Foo>::bar();
    // Note that if we made `Foo` work then
    // presumably this would work too:
    <(Foo, Foo)>::bar()
}
```

Felix wonders if adding a feature like
`TypeCtor<..>` ==> `TypeCtor<_, _, _>` (as many as needed)
would help here, in terms of providing the basis for
a simple rule for how to desugar `Foo` into some kind
of `Foo<~~~~~>`

# `?` carrier trait results

- did a crater run where try! used `?` and there was a carrier trait with more than one impl
- got 30-some odd regressions all along the axis
- but this does not incorporate the limitation of not converting between `Option`
- how to encode these type rules? hard
- an option might be to do the dummy type and not convert `try!`
- but we can use the PR one more time to double-check that we see a similar set of breakage

# Public in private

```
// error
trait PrivateTrait { type Assoc; }

// not error?
mod foo {
    pub trait PrivateTrait { type Assoc; }
}
use foo::PrivateTrait;

fn foo<T>() -> <T as PrivateTrait>::Assoc
where T: PrivateTrait
```

```
type Alias = u64;
pub fn foo(x: Alias) { }
```
