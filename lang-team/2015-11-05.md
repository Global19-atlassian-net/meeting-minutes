# Agenda

- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1296 FCP

# Triage

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29149

- tricky,  because we don't want the copy/move distinction to be based on what region is in play, since those are not known at trans (and are inferred in typeck)
- perhaps we should conservatively treat this as affine
- or perhaps we should rule out the impl itself
- have to ponder it!

# RFCs

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1323

just summarized state, good to read

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1327
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1327#issuecomment-149329351
      - unclear how to impl it, stretches defn of Drop
      - but also it makes things as unsafe as possible, then slowly makes it more safe
  - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1327#issuecomment-149781854
    - nice, an idea that's been discussed also with last RFC
    - last time we tried to discuss it, it seemed like it was hard to figure out just what the implications were of being ?Alive
    - maybe there is a blunt version that will work

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1275
    - last time we talked we decided to pursue #[naked] first as it is more general
    - propose closing in favor of a naked-based approach?

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1300
    - just documents existing policy...FCP?
    - nmatsakis is fine with it so long as this is not considered to be stabilzing intrinsics

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/733
