# Modules

Consequences:
    
    1. You don't need to write `mod` anymore.
    2. You can tell by looking at an item where it is visible ('>=').
    
Idea:
    
    1. Every file in your src would be tracked as a module (regardless of mod).
    2. An implicit module is as public as its most public member.
    
    pub use self::foo::Bar;

    pub fn make_baz() -> self::foo::Baz { }

    pub fn make_raz() -> foo::Raz { }
    
    mod foo {
        pub(super) struct Bar;
        pub(super) struct Baz;
        pub(restricted) struct Raz;
    }

    ----

    // top of foo.rs
    pub mod;
    // alternatively:
    pub self;

    // Equivalent of "pub mod foo" in parent module.

    ----
    
    struct Private { }
    pub use self::Private; // made Private Public
    
    ----

FFI-ish facade:

```
#[cfg(windows)]
#[path = win_foo.rs]
mod foo;

#[cfg(linux)]
#[path = linux_foo.rs]
mod foo;
```

```
#[cfg(windows)]
mod win_foo;

#[cfg(windows)]
pub use self::win_foo::*;

#[cfg(linux)]
mod linux_foo;

#[cfg(linux)]
pub use self::linux_foo::*;
```


How nmatsakis thinks about it:
    - when you declare `pub(X) struct S` it means that `S` is nameable from `X` **at this path**
    - but a `pub use` within that scope could grow it beyond that

    ----

Feeling:
    - this is a big change, would be a hard sell
    - too many ways to do it
    - works maybe if we say facading is deprecated
        - but then supporting portability etc

    ----
    
    
    
Stack of concerns:
    
    - nmatsakis: pub-in-private is very complex and we don't have consensus on how it should work; how does it fit in here
