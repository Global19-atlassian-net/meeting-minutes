# Action Items

- Close #1201 (nmatsakis), cite prior RFC #55 
- Close #1154, cite issue #294
- Merge #873
- Close #1150 (nmatsakis)
- IndexSet => FCP

# Triage

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1209
  - assigned to nmatsakis
  - nominate for FCP

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1201
  - naked functions
  - precedent: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/55
  - conclusion:
    - let's close as premature, low-level stabilization 

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1154
  - close under #294

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1129

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/873
  - merge (right?)

# Rust issues

 - big picture: in general, assume that PR's with known breaking
   changes of the form "X becomes a compile-time error" simply have to
   go through a warning cycle before the hard error is turned on.
 
# FCPs

- macros in types https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/873
  - feature-gate period should provide time for us to hammer out issues here

- "'_" https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1177
   - some open questions:
     - `'_` in a return type, should it be always fresh?
     - `'_` in a trait object bound, needs more discussion
     - could use it to signal when elision is hiding regions
       - but without a lint people will probably not do that

- dropck
  - try to use an unsafe attribute temporarily
  - run experiment: add this attribute to all collections, run crater

- efficient inheritance
  - met with jdm
  - design seems good
