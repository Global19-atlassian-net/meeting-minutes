Same tradeoffs, no new input, hold off for now.

- #1196, eliding type parameters

Use case from bluss for defaulted type parameters:

```
struct PetGraph<N, E, W=(), Ix=u32> { }

impl<N,E> PetGraph {
    fn new() -> PetGraph<N,E> { }
}

impl<N,E,W,Ix> PetGraph {
    fn new() -> PetGraph<N,E,W,Ix> { }
}
```

Without fallback, no nice way to specify that you want the default for
one type parameter but not the others:

```
let graph: PetGraph<N, E, _, u64> = PetGraph::default(); // <-- bluss's use case
// _ ==> fresh type variable which will be unconstrained
```

However, instead of fallback, we could potentially introduce a syntax
for this:

```
let graph: PetGraph<N, E, Ix=u64> = PetGraph::default();

// better yet: (if N, E can be inferred)
let graph: PetGraph<Ix=u64> = PetGraph::default();

// why is this not fallback? (in niko's proposed semantics, this means "*infer* W, ignoring its default")
let graph: PetGraph<W=_, Ix=u64> = PetGraph::default();
```

- aturon: can we change semantics of `PetGraph<N, E, _, u64> so that it uses defaults?
- nmatsakis: backwards incompatible, and it's useful to be able to say "not the default but I don't want to tell you what it is"
- aturon: but it would help drive towards more compatible
- nmatsakis: what this RFC says: foo::<T> ==> foo::<T,_> are equivalent (if foo has >= two type parameters)
- nmatsakis: so the inconsistency is what happens when the type parameter is elided completely:
      - types: use default
      - non-types: use `_`
- aturon: rand crate blocked on this rfc?
- huon: just because syntactically it'd be a pain
- aturon: can we punt?
- pnkfelix: would it make sense to add an explicit token to say "give me the default"

# Questions about privacy

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/29973

```
type Foo = SomethingPublic;
pub fn func(x: Foo) { }

pub type Foo = SomethingPublic;
pub fn func(x: Foo) { }
```

```
const Foo: u32 = 4;
pub fn func(x: [T; Foo]) { }
```

"lint"

- nrc: you might think you are entitled to change `Foo` because it is priv, but it will cause downstream crates not to compile
- nmatsakis: but goal is to defend *abstraction boundary* not *semvar* --
  - caller could always be doing `func([0,0,0,0])` today
  - and if you change it to 5, caller will just not compile
  - caller knows the value
- pnkfelix: if you kept it abstract...?
- nrc: if we took the stricter rules, then the private value IS abstract
- impact: 8 crates

```
mod x {
    struct Foo;
    
    mod y {
        use super::Foo;
        pub fn (x: Foo); // is this legal or not?
    }
}
```

```
mod x{
    struct Foo;
    
    mod y {
        use super::Foo;
        pub(super) fn(x: Foo); // legal
    }
}
```

- Conclusion: stick to the RFC, prefer the stricter semantics
