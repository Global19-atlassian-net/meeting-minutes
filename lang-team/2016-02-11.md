# name resolution and shadowing

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31337

Conclusion:
    - take option 2: leave things as they are but fix rustdoc

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31377

- Defer to RFC to decide, this is a tricky question

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31376

- Not accept because of #31337

```
use foo::Import;

fn decl() { }

mod submodule {
    use super::*;
    // can I name `Import`?
    // can I name `decl`?
}
```

# let / else

https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1303

- Discussion has died down
- Sticking points:
	- Doesn't feel very general because `else` branch has no bindings
	    - sort of an anti-pattern for results
	- Parsing ambiguity 
- Other points:
	- gradual build-up of syntactic sugar; some overlap with `catch` and `?`
- FCP

# Inference fallback

- A lot of uncertainty here
- related to https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1196
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30123
- `let ug = Graph::<i32, i32, _>::new_undirected();`
- Some options:
    - implement the "conservative" fallback semantics
    - amend RFC to remove inference fallback
- Required:
    - someone needs to writeup the state and lay it out (aturon)
- In the meantime:
    - remove #1196 from FCP
