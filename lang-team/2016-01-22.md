# RFC 243

- aturon:
	- Lots of discussion since the FCP was announced.
	- Might as well extend the FCP period by another week just to ease concerns.
	- Biggest concern seems to be the `try/catch` vs `?` as separate RFCs question.
- nmatsakis: Huon proposed using two distinct feature gates, seem like a reasonable thing one might do.
- aturon: ...
- nrc: my read is that when threads get this long, a lot of moderate people zone out
- nrc: in terms of going out of FCP or not, I don't see anything changing by too much, but it also seems like there's no great rush
- nmatsakis: one thing is that I'd prefer to update the RFC in some minor ways to bring it fully in sync:
    - calling out explicit unresolved questions about try/catch and a few other details
    - two feature gates
- nrc: we could do a PR against gabhor's PR
- aturon: there are some other minor issues we might add in, in particular choice of keywords
- nmatsakis: my concern is that it might be better to discuss choice of keywords in a separate discuss threads, free of baggage
- nrc: I don't mind try/catch personally
- aturon: my concern is that `try!` vs `try` is confusing, and the analogy to other exception systems is not quite right
- aturon: I prefer `catch`/`match` over `try`/`catch` since you plan to catch all the `?` flows
- nrc: I'm not a fan of `match`
- huon: isn't the `catch` part exactly a match?
- aturon: yes but just the error part
- consensus:
	- two feature gates
	- introduce an unresolved question over keyword choice and maybe a few other things
	- extend FCP by 1 week
	- open PR against PR and make comment

- Open issue that claims ought to be fixed: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29548

# Issue 27336

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27336
- nmatsakis: Certainly not FCP, since the semantics are not what is described in RFC, and I kind of want to remove the feature altogether
- nmatsakis: In fact I just expanded feature gate in the most recent beta

# RFC 938

- nobody is really in favor, not a priority right now, let's just close

# PR 30882

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30882
- Was a bug whereby enum variants from different crates did not get added into the type namespace
- Will break code but is a bug fix
- Crater run suggests 3 regressions
- Two things being fixed here:
    - strict bug fix where non-struct variants from cross-crate were not being put into the type namespace
	    - broken 3 crates
    - Struct variants from other crates were not being put into the value namespace
		- weird but true: we do this for struct variants from the same crate
		- future-proofing if we wanted to put struct variant names into the value namespace
		- no known breakage
- Question:
     - should we do these fixes?
		- nmatsakis: yes, since it's imporant for backwards compat, and since we enforce locally is a clear bug fix
	- aturon: we should do them I don't think we need a warning cycle given the breakage
- Consensus:
    - land it

# RFC 1444

- Semantics:
    - exactly like a C union in representation
    - you can project out a particular interpretation (unsafe to do)
	    - field access syntax
    - you create by specifying some variant
    - no destructor runs
- `untagged_union`
- `#[repr(union)] struct Foo`
- `union!`
- `#[repr(C,union)] unsafe enum Foo { ... }`
- motivations?
	- FFI
	- manually drop
	- serializations and binary data
- aturon: acrichto and pcwalton felt disinclined to add a first-class feature that is about C, not Rust
- nmatsakis, nrc: +1, wycats felt similarly
- aturon: BUT it's more than "just a matter of changing the layout", seems to change the semantics deeply though
- nmatsakis: seems clear that it's stretching `#[repr(union)]` very far
- nrc: changing construction is sort of stepping over the line on what `#[repr]` should do, but the argument against 1st class union seems to counteract that
- nrc: if we're not going to have a first class data type, then you either have
	- modifying keyword
	- or attribute other than `#[repr]`
- nrc: to me, having the modifier keyword that changes fundamentally what the data structure is feels even *worse* than the `#[repr]`
- nmatsakis: I also agree that `union struct` feels worse
- aturon: making it a macro feels second class to me too...?
- nmatsakis: but it really does want deeper integration in the compiler, if it could readily be done in a macro we'd certainly have done so
- nmatsakis: that said there have been some suggestions about having macros that generate accessors but...
- nrc: ...FFI is really important, should be ergonomic, and it can be very painful right now
- pnkfelix: main thing I was thinking about was a future version of rust where unions would be safe because the user would have put explicit discriminants in but...
- pnkfelix: ...it's all very far future
- pnkfelix: trying to find some way to justify it without resorting to crazy pie in the sky ideas
- pnkfelix: what I want to get across though is that, aiui, the thing that made nrc adopt his position is the ergonomics of projection
- pnkfelix: e.g. `value.field_name` in this proposal
- pnkfelix: we could also accomplish that by making `value.VariantName` for enums (or at least unsafe enums)
- nrc: I considered this before going all in on the structs-with-fields approach but my feeling was:
	- we have exactly a syntax for accessing a value with a dot
	- it's a struct
	- seems to be like a major change to the language
- pnkfelix: yes but we have method calls to
- nrc: right, we have fields, and we have method calls, and these are big fundamental things, and now we're adding a third thing that also uses dot, which implies same rules around deref and so forth, variant matching, it's a huge change to how people would use enums
- pnkfelix: hmm interaction with autoderef
- aturon: why the dot anyway? why not as?
- nrc: this was my proposal that I abandoned, but to me it has the same or more drawbacks to pnkfelix's idea:
	- one drawback is that you are suggesting adding `as` to all enums, but we only want it for unions
	- if you have something that has a completely different way of accessing it, it is not the same data structure
- aturon: huh?
- nrc: if you're saying we've got enums and unsafe enums, you're saying:
    - they're basically the same but represent them differently
    - and access them differently
- nmatsakis: let me rephrase what nrc said:
    - when you use a normal enum, you match and it takes you to the right arm
    - but for union it's the opposite, you have to pick the arm
    - unergonomic to write `(foo as Variant).data` compared to `foo.variant.data`
    - but also if you add `foo as Variant` for unsafe enums, you want it for safe ones too, and now we got this checked downcast for no particular reason, just because we wanted FFI?
- aturon: feels like unions are a 3rd thing but we don't want to admit it
- nmatsakis: yes
- aturon: but maybe we should just admit it?
- nmatsakis: maybe. I've sort of come around that we should have `#[repr(union)]` and `union`
- nmatsakis: my feeling is that "product-vs-sum" type dilmena 
- pnkfelix: the integration with the borrow checker shows it's not same thing (as a struct ... [[niko: nor an enum]])
- nmatsais: you could make a case that borrow checker hsould treat them as disjoint, depends if we want union to be like an enum, where exactly one interpretation is valid ("disjoint union"), or like a C union, where sometimes multiple repr are simultaneously valid
- nmatsakis: i.e., can the fact that you used it in one way be evidence that using it in another way is not supposed to be possible
- aturon: what is the concern about writing union EXACTLY -- it's not necessarily true that it must be covered on equal footing with `sturct` and `enum` just because it has its own keyword?
- nmatsakis: yes-- though some rust book or other will do so :)
- aturon: people will use it as much as they will, however it's spelled
- nrc: maybe; I guess I fear people getting wrong signal and employing it as a (likely premature) optimization
- nrc: having this conversation softened my opposition to keyword somewhat
- nmatsakis: I do wonder about the grammar question, maybe we can use the official grammar to try and decide if we can get away with something
