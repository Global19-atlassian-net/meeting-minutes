### virtual structs and mutability

- aturon: I'd prefer to avoid making yet more distinctions; Rust is full of them
  - other ways to achieve the end; e.g. wrapper types w/ deref
- nmatsakis: most straightforward way is accessors, but those suffer
- pnkfelix: could we add a new attribute that applies equally well to both?

- most straightforward:
    - have to tag with mut in order to assign to those fields directly
    - but still it must be in a mutable context
    - &T where T: Trait you can't assign to a mut trait field

- woudln't want it to look like structs but where structs don't allow `mut`

trait Foo {
    let x: T;
    let mut x: T;
}

OR

```
trait Foo {
    x: T
    // in future, allow this but also in structs:
    readonly x: T;
}
```

OR

```
struct Foo {
    x: U,
    mut x: T
}
```

- if you have a mut, assigning to a non-mut field is disallowed
- no muts at all is today's behavior
    - with a lint that defaults to allow for assigning directly to a **field** not marked as mut
    
Thoughts of how to make this more concrete:
    
- gather some statistics 
- what percentage of fields are directly assigned vs being set in constructor

- in practice, it feels like privacy gives us most of what we need
