# RFC 243

- Decision: `catch` only, no second clause
- Justification:
    - `catch { } match { }` changes type of the surrounding expression in a way that might be confusing
    - `catch { }.unwrap_or(|| ...)` is pretty close, addresses the use cases nmatsakis raised
    - `catch { }` is the real added expressiveness
    - easier to add `match` later than to change keyword probably
    - note that to reach final judgement on `catch` we will want `Option` support probably

# RFC 1210

- Gabhor's critique / aturon, nmatsakis response:
    - overlapping instances is similar and reviled
	    - but because of lack of coherence, primarily
    - rewrite rules are another alternative
	    - but also breaks parametricity
    - copying C++
	    - but basically required for 0CA

Some other concerns:
    - arielb1's concern about inheriting default from trait
    - `default impl` for better defaults
		- separate feature gate
		- but feature can be seen as living on a continuum
		- helpful for virtual structs / "efficient code reuse"

# Inheritance

## Souring on the struct inheritance idea

I wrote this: https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/53eebbeac4ab7c434f1e
    
Turns out, if we want to combine with nested enum hierarchies, we can't represent it:

```
struct NodeFields { ... }
struct ElementFields { ... }
enum Node: NodeFields { 
    ...
    
    enum Element: ElementFields {
        ...
    }
}

// Take 1:
// <discr> NodeFields ElementFields
// T: NodeFields, then NodeFields is a prefix of T

// NodeFields <discr> ElementFields
// T: ElementFields, but ElementFields is a prefix of T
	
struct Foo: BarFields { }   // <- no subtyping relationship here, or even between &Foo and &BarFields 
trait Bar: BarFields

&Foo => &Bar
```

## Alternative proposal

Let's get even closer to Eddyb/Kimundi's proposal

Additional features needed beyond specialization:

- Simple embedding syntax for structs
- Fields in traits
- Embedding struct in traits
- `#[repr(thin)]`

```
// Go-like syntax, perhaps?
struct NodeFields {
    f: u32,
    g: u32
}

struct ElementFields {
    ..NodeFields, 
    h: u32,
    i: u32
}
```

```
trait Node { f: u32, g: u32 } // <-- fields can appear anywhere in the implementing type

#[repr(prefix)] // fields must be a prefix in the implementing type
// and/or: #[repr(thin)]
trait Node { f: u32, g: u32 }
```

```
struct Element { Node.., ... }
Element { ..., ..node }
```
