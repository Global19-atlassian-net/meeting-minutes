# Agenda

- Triage
  - Triage of rfcs PRs
  - Triage of rust PRs + issues too?
- Triage policy: Is our domain really solely RFCs ?
  - Do "course corrections" go through RFC process? And Breaking-change bug-fixes?
- &mut T -> &Cell<T> brainteaser

# Action Items (also carry over from last week)

- Close #1216 (nmatsakis)
- FCP #1219 (nmatsakis)

# Triage of new RFCs

- RFC https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1216

nmatsakis: seems like not enough benefit for the complexity
nmatsakis: modeling with an explicit enum feels like... not bad

- RFC https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1219

- Issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060
  - not specific to SIMD
  - seems like we would ideally disallow references into packed structures
  - or make them unsafe
  - could also feature-gate repr(packed), at least for now
  - if we made it unsafe, interesting ramifications for
    fields-in-traits, since they would have to point at an aligned
    field or else be declared unsafe
  - next step: do a crater run where #[repr(packed)] is feature-gated
  
- Issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26952
  - nmatsakis: I've been investigating regressions with brson, there
    was one that I didn't know cause of, might be related to this
  
- PR https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26421
  - waiting for PR author to impl a warning cycle
  
- PR https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25509

- Issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20489
  - we do not enforce any limits on the types used in patterns
  - do not have to impl PartialEQ etc
  - has impliciations for exhaustiveness as well, e.g.:

```
const TRUE: bool = true;
const FALSE: bool = false;

fn main() {
    match true { 
        TRUE => 1,
        FALSE => 2,
    };
}
```

  - this doesn't work with associated constants though
  - special case (static error check) rule rejecting `NaN` but this won't work with assoc constants

```
trait Constant {
    const Foo: f32;
}

fn foo<T:Constant>(x: f32) {
    match x {
        T::Foo => _,
    }
}
```

  - kind of a mess of problems, unclear what best solution is
  - but we should settle on some rules, make an RFC, and then have a warning cycle
  
  - nmatsakis: I feel if both of these are accepted then they should be equivalent:
  
```
match x {
    CONSTANT => ... 
}
```

```
if x == CONSTANT {
    ...
}
```

  - pnkfelix: we could use Eq to ensure that you don't match on floats
  - pnkfelix: (but there is a quibble about how to handle ranges --
    match f32 { lo...hi => ... } should still be okay)

  - if we don't want arbitrary code to execute, and we respect the
    principle above, we have to prohibit constants of
    non-builtin-types. This may be a big breaking change.
  - Next step: crater run to see what breaks when types are restricted
    to tuples of builtin types

- `&mut T` -> `&Cell<T>` brainteaser:
  - huon: is this a safe transformation?
  - nmatsakis: I believe it is ok. Reasoning:
    - for duration of the `&mut` loan, nobody else can read it
    - once you're `&Cell<T>` is finished, it goes back to its original status
  - pnkfelix: what about `*mut` -> `&Cell<T>`?
  - conclusion: not safe in general because
    - (a) you don't know that the *mut is valid for the lifetime
    - (b) *mut could be accessed by another thread 
    - (c) or uninitialized
