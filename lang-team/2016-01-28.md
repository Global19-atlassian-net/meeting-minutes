- accept provisionally, one more week to decide keywords

# Decisions

Accept this change, but discuss adding new volatile operaitons
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30962

r+, and address confusing cases through a lint
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31144

Wait for an RFC that addresses the full case, including type params
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31179

Close and ask for RFC
